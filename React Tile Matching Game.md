**Project Description: React Tile Matching Game**

---

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the React Tile Matching Game project! In this practical exercise, you will be creating a React application that allows users to play a tile matching game similar to Mahjong. 

**Project Requirements:**

1. **User Name Entry:**
   - Before playing, the user provides their name, which is stored in the browser's local storage.
   - Reference screen: [Welcome Screen](https://img.enacton.com/ShareX/2023/10/mspaint_P0SkTc0KB1.png)

2. **Gameplay:**
   - After submitting their name, the user can start playing the game.
   - The game board looks like this: [Game Board](https://img.enacton.com/ShareX/2023/10/mspaint_Xgrdu0T57M.png)
   
3. **Game Objective:**
   - The objective of the game is to reveal matching tiles on the board in a timely manner.

4. **Tile Selection:**
   - Users can randomly select any tile on the board to reveal it.

5. **Scoring:**
   - When the user matches two tiles, they are awarded 1 point.
   - If the user fails to match the tiles, 1 point is deducted.
   - The current score is displayed in the top left corner of the board.

6. **Time Tracking:**
   - The app tracks how much time the user spends in solving the entire board, displayed in the top right corner of the board.

7. **Game Completion:**
   - Once the user finishes the game, a success screen is displayed showing the final score and time taken, like this: [Success Screen](https://img.enacton.com/ShareX/2023/10/mspaint_GZTUKMHgZP.png)

**Deliverables:**

1. **React Application:**
   - Create a React application with appropriate components and state management.

2. **User Name Entry Component:**
   - Implement a component for entering the user's name and storing it in the browser's local storage.

3. **Game Board Component:**
   - Develop a component to display the game board with interactive tiles.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - Implement the game logic for matching tiles, scoring, and time tracking.

5. **Success Screen Component:**
   - Create a component to display the success screen with final score and time taken.
